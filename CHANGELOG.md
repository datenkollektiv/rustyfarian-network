## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Wi-Fi + MQTT provisioning profile — the provisioning triad generalises from one schema to a closed set of named `SchemaProfile`s built from reusable field groups (Core / LoRaWAN / MQTT / OTA). Two profiles ship: `LorawanFieldDevice` (Wi-Fi creds + LoRaWAN OTAA keys + OTA URL + device name, today's behaviour) and the new `WifiMqttDevice` (Wi-Fi creds + MQTT broker + OTA URL + device name, no LoRaWAN). `parse_form` is now profile-parameterised; `ProvisioningConfig` carries optional `LoraFields` / `MqttFields` groups; cross-profile fields are rejected via a Form-level `ValidationError::UnexpectedForProfile`. MQTT credentials are first-class — typed validation (`mqtt_uri` shape, `1..=65535` port, optional auth with an asymmetric guard that rejects password-without-username, 23-byte client ID), redacting `Debug`, and no HTML prefill for `mqtt_pass`. Plain `mqtt://` only; MQTT-over-TLS stays out of scope. Per [ADR 014](docs/adr/014-wifi-mqtt-provisioning-profile.md).
- `MqttConfig::with_username_only` — sets a username with no password, for brokers that authorise by username alone. Omits the CONNECT packet's password field rather than transmitting an empty string, which is semantically distinct on the wire from `with_auth(user, "")` and is what username-only ACLs typically expect. Used by `idf_c3_provision_mqtt`'s `mqtt_config_from_stored`.
- `rustyfarian-network-pure` gains a `no_std`-safe surface — `#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]` with a default-enabled `std` feature that gates `format_broker_url`, `spawn_subscriber_thread`, `QoS`, and the `SubscribeClient` trait (the latter pair bound by `anyhow`, which is now optional behind `std`). The validators (`validate_client_id`, `CLIENT_ID_MAX_LEN`, topic validators), `backoff.rs`, and `status_colors.rs` compile under `no_std`, so `provisioning-pure` consumes them with `default-features = false`. MQTT consumers keep the default `std` feature and are unaffected.
- NVS provisioning schema v2 — adds a `profile` discriminator key (`lorawan` | `wifi_mqtt`, written before `schema_ver`) and the MQTT keys (`mqtt_host`, `mqtt_port`, `mqtt_user`, `mqtt_pass`, `mqtt_client`). `load` reads `schema_ver == 1` / absent-`profile` records as the `lorawan` profile, so deployed beekeeper devices are not re-provisioned; `save` writes only the active group and removes the inactive one.
- `idf_c3_provision_mqtt` example — host contract for the `WifiMqttDevice` profile: open store → check provisioned → run the builder with `SchemaProfile::WifiMqttDevice` → `wait_committed` → construct the downstream `MqttConfig` → reboot, with a `derive_client_id` helper that truncates the device name to 23 bytes on a char boundary when `mqtt_client` is blank.
- Provisioning triad (`provisioning-pure` + `rustyfarian-esp-idf-provisioning`) — SoftAP captive-portal provisioning, NVS persistence, a wildcard DNS catch-all, and a backend-neutral state machine. `provisioning-pure` is `no_std` and host-testable (form parsing, per-field validation, SSID derivation); `rustyfarian-esp-idf-provisioning` is the ESP-IDF binding (builder/session/store/portal/dns). Secrets are never echoed into HTML and a per-session nonce guards `POST` routes. Per [ADR 013](docs/adr/013-softap-provisioning-acceptance.md); the schema-profile generalisation arrived under [ADR 014](docs/adr/014-wifi-mqtt-provisioning-profile.md).
- SoftAP support in `wifi-pure` (`ApConfig`, `validate_ap_config`, AP constants) and `rustyfarian-esp-idf-wifi` (`SoftApManager` over `Configuration::AccessPoint`, plus a `softap_mac()` efuse helper for SSID derivation before the radio starts).
- `idf_c3_provision` example — full host contract for the captive portal: open store → check provisioned → run the builder → `wait_committed` → reboot.
- `MqttBuilder::with_startup_message()` — opt-in startup notification on every (re)connect. When enabled, the builder publishes `"1"` to `iot/{client_id}/startup` (`QoS::AtLeastOnce`, not retained) via `client.enqueue()` immediately when the broker transitions to `Connected`, before any user-supplied `on_connect` callback runs. The publish and the user callback run under a single internal mutex acquisition, so the startup message is always first in the outgoing queue. Failed publishes are logged at `warn!` and do not abort the connection. Replaces the deprecated `MqttHandle::send_startup_message()` for the common case — the builder handles the (re)connect lifecycle automatically.
- `MqttBuilder::subscribe(topic, qos)` — registers topics for automatic (re)subscription without blocking the event loop. Subscriptions are sent from a short-lived thread spawned after `on_connect` returns, avoiding the SUBACK deadlock introduced in `esp-idf-svc 0.52+`.
- `EspIdfEspNow::init_with_radio_sta` — opt-in fallback that keeps the prior unassociated-STA radio behaviour of `init_with_radio`, using a promiscuous-bracket channel re-pin before every send.  Documented ~0–20 % `ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_CHAN` rate; use only when SoftAP conflicts with BLE coexistence or a user-facing AP. See ADR 012.
- `idf_c3_espnow_scout_promisc` example — companion to `idf_c3_espnow_scout` demonstrating the `init_with_radio_sta` fallback with an explicit connected / scanning state machine so failures recover cleanly.
- `ScanConfig::probe_confirmations` and `ScanConfig::confirmation_gap` — gap-spaced confirmation probes after the first ACK on a channel, defending against false-positive channel detection when the peer is mid-roam.

### Fixed

- `MqttBuilder::on_connect` callback deadlocks when `client.subscribe()` is called inside it on `esp-idf-svc 0.52+`. `EspMqttClient::subscribe()` blocks until the broker sends SUBACK; since the callback runs on the event loop thread, that thread cannot process the SUBACK and hangs. The new `.subscribe()` builder method eliminates the footgun.
  **Migration:** move every `client.subscribe()` call out of `on_connect` and onto the builder via `.subscribe(topic, qos)`. See `crates/rustyfarian-esp-idf-mqtt/examples/idf_c3_mqtt_button_oled.rs` (publisher) and `idf_c3_mqtt_led_grid.rs` (subscriber) for a working pair.
- ESP-NOW unassociated-STA channel drift: the ESP-IDF Wi-Fi driver's autonomous background scanner hops the radio off the channel set by `scan_for_peer` within milliseconds, causing every subsequent `send_and_wait` to land on the wrong channel.  `init_with_radio` now starts a hidden SoftAP on channel 1; beacon scheduling holds the channel deterministically and eliminates the need for per-send workarounds.  See ADR 012.
- ESP-NOW `scan_for_peer` failure cascade: a failed re-scan previously left the radio on the last-probed channel with the peer registration removed, so the next `send_and_wait` aborted before TX.  The `Err` branch now restores both the peer registration and the radio channel from the last successful scan.

### Changed

- All documentation examples updated to use `.subscribe()` on the builder instead of `client.subscribe()` inside `on_connect`. The `on_connect` callback should now be used only for `client.enqueue()` (retained-state publishes).
- `MqttHandle::send_startup_message()` deprecation note now points at `MqttBuilder::with_startup_message()` as the primary migration path; the secondary `publish() / publish_with()` pointer is preserved for custom lifecycle messages.
- **BREAKING (semantics)** — `EspIdfEspNow::init_with_radio` now starts the radio in **SoftAP mode** instead of unassociated STA mode, and `default_interface()` consequently returns `WifiInterface::Ap` instead of `WifiInterface::Sta`.  Downstream code that hard-coded `WifiInterface::Sta` on a driver-owned radio must either call `default_interface()` or migrate to the new `init_with_radio_sta` to preserve the prior behaviour.
- ESP-NOW driver internals: replaced implicit `(_wifi.is_some(), wifi_interface)` branching with an explicit private `RadioMode` enum (`CallerManagedSta` / `OwnedSoftAp` / `OwnedStaPromisc`).  Behaviour-preserving for all three constructors; the unsafe promiscuous-bracket send path now lives in a dedicated `send_with_promisc_repin` helper.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- Adopt `rustyfarian-ws2812 v0.5.0` retag covering the upstream crate renames `led-effects` → `pennant` and `ws2812-pure` → `bunting`. Workspace dependency `led-effects` becomes `pennant`; `rustyfarian-esp-hal-ws2812` feature flag `led-effects` becomes `pennant`. All `use led_effects::…` imports updated to `use pennant::…`. The two HAL drivers stay on git (not yet on crates.io) so `pennant` is also kept as a git dep — sharing the source guarantees a single compiled copy and unifies `StatusLed` / `PulseEffect` across the HAL boundary.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-06

This release introduces an OTA MVP across both stacks, completes the April 2026 `esp-hal` upgrade wave, and switches bare-metal Wi-Fi to an async-only API built on `embassy-net`.

### Added

- OTA MVP — three new experimental crates (`ota-pure`, `rustyfarian-esp-idf-ota`, `rustyfarian-esp-hal-ota`) for end-to-end firmware update
- Bare-metal async Wi-Fi via the new `embassy` Cargo feature on `rustyfarian-esp-hal-wifi`
- ESP-NOW peer discovery, reliable delivery, and the Peripheral Command Framework
- Wi-Fi TX power and power-save configuration in `wifi-pure`
- MQTT non-blocking publishes, `StatusLed` boot feedback, and configurable task stack / reconnect timeout

### Changed

- **BREAKING** — bare-metal Wi-Fi is now async-only; the synchronous `WiFiManager` surface and the `hal_*_connect` examples are gone
- **BREAKING** — `esp-radio 0.18` API renames cascade through `rustyfarian-esp-hal-wifi`
- April 2026 `esp-hal` stack wave: `esp-hal 1.1.0`, `esp-rtos 0.3.0`, `esp-radio 0.18.0`, plus matching embassy pins

### Fixed

- ESP-NOW channel-scan and `send_and_wait` race conditions
